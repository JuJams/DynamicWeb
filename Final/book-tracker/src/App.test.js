// Test file - placeholder for future tests
// I learned about testing from class, but didn't implement full test suite for this project
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import App from './App';

// Basic test to ensure app renders
test('renders app', () => {
  render(<App />);
  // App should render without crashing
});
